# AI Framework

An experimental AI chatbot framework designed for Discord integration, featuring mood-aware responses, memory management, and recursive thinking capabilities.

## Features

- **Mood-Aware Responses**: The chatbot adjusts its tone based on user interactions, reflecting moods such as happy, annoyed, or angry.
- **Memory Management**: Remembers user interactions and facts, allowing for contextually relevant conversations.
- **Recursive Thinking**: Employs a recursive approach to process queries and generate responses.
- **Discord Integration**: Includes a ready-to-use Discord bot example (`bot.py`).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Discord account and server(s)
- Discord 'bot' token
